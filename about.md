# Guess Louisville's Crime Rates

## How This Works
* Draw on the charts.  Click at the end of the chart, then drag to estimate how you think different crime rates have trended since 2012.
* Once you get to the end of the chart, they will fill in with the true crime rate, based on police statistics.
	+ Crime rates are reported on a `Per Thousand Population` basis.
* This dashboard was built using data from the [Louisville Open Data Portal's Crime Data set](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-data).  
* Crime rates are a function of the number of crimes committed per year based on the `Crime Type` listed in the citation, and population.
	+ Population for Louisville Metro comes from the census.
* This dashboard was built using [shinysense](https://github.com/nstrayer/shinysense) from Nick Strayer.
* Strayer has said he was inspired by the New York Times' feature, [You Draw It](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html)
